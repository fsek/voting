    title: Cookies
    general:
      first: Cookies are small text files which are downloaded to your computer, tablet or mobile phone when you visit a website or application. The website or application may retrieve these cookies from your web browser (eg Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome) each time you visit, so they can recognise you, remember your preferences and provide you with a more secure online experience.
      second: Generally, cookies are very useful and are a common method used by almost every website you visit because they help to make your online experience as smooth as possible. For security reasons, many websites will not function at all without the use of cookies (or other similar technologies, such as "web beacons" or "tags").
      third: Cookies generally do not hold any information to identify an individual person, but are instead used to identify a browser on an individual machine.
      fourth: If you prefer, you can restrict, block or delete cookies by changing your browser settings but that may mean that the website won't work properly or more information about cookies and their impact on you and your browsing visit
