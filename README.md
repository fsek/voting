# Röstsystem - a system to assist your general meetings

## Use case
The system helps handling presence and adjustment of election registering, the agenda of the meeting and votes.


## Getting started
The application is written in Ruby on Rails, download the repository and run the `bin/setup` script to get started. It requires [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) and [Bundler](http://bundler.io/).

## Tests
The application uses [RSpec](http://rspec.info/) for all tests, they are run with the command `rspec`.

## Deployment
The application can easily be deployed to e.g. [Heroku](https://heroku.com). The `master`-branch is automatically deployed to a Heroku-instance controlled by the authors.

## Contributions
All contributions are very welcome.

**Bugs** can be reported in the issue tracker as well as new **features**.

Feel free to open **pull requests** with any changes or use the application on your own, just adhere to the license.
