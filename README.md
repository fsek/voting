# Röstsystem - a system to assist your general meetings

## History
The development of Röstsytem started in the end of 2015, [Jakob](https://github.com/navro) did the first development and was then assisted by [David](https://github.com/davidwessman). The system have been used at several general meetings at [F-sektionen](https://fsektionen.se) and also some times at other organisations at LTH in Lund.

## Functions
The system helps handling presence and adjustment of election registering, the agenda of the meeting and votes.

## Getting started
The application is written in Ruby on Rails, download the repository and run the `bin/setup` script to get started. It requires [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) and [Bundler](http://bundler.io/).
